# 1D single ion simulation

This project is intended to host programs demonstrating two integration algorithms used in molecular dynamics : velocity-Verlet and Runge-Kutta 4. I developed those codes during my PhD thesis. The framework in which those code are intended to be included are the trapping of a single ion in a 1D radio-frequency field.

It is the support for further implementation of poly-ion dynamics, which requires to consider Coulomb repulsion. The transition to 3D is also a requirement in order to provide an actual functional code.
